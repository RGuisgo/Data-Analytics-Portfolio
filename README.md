# Trend analysis and forecasting of yearly temperature and rainfall in some African countries using Bayesian Autoregressive and Random walk models

## Abstract
In this paper, we examine the trends and forecasting of yearly rainfall and temperature data in ten African countries in the West, South, East, and North ( Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Namibia, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Egypt, and Tunisia) using Bayesian Autoregressive and Random walk models, each of order one. The performance of the two models were compared based on Deviance Information Criterion and Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion and the results show that the random walk model provides better fit to the temperature data for all the countries, for the rainfall data, the autoregressive model provides a better fit. While the projections of the autoregressive model indicates a downward pattern for virtually all the countries, the random walk model gave patterns that are somehow consistent with the observed trend in the immediate past few years though their wider credible intervals indicate higher level of uncertainty about the predictions. The implications of the autoregressive model results obtained is that, temperature will have a decreasing pattern in the future and rainfall will have a trend consistent with the observed in the original data.
